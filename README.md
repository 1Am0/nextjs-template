This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install VSCode, Git, and Node.js on your computer.
    - Optionally, install GitHub Desktop for an easier experience.
    - Depending on your computer, you may have to configure the PATH Environment Variable to support Node.js and Git
3. Click 'Fork' near the top of the repository display.
4. Click 'Create Fork' and navigate to the repository in your profile.
5. Click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS URL.
6. Clone the repository with either GitHub Desktop or the command: `git clone <URL>` in your desired folder.
  - This might error you if your PATH Environment Variable isn't configured, there's lots of documentation of this fix online, though.
8. Open the folder in VSCode and open VSCode's terminal.
9. Run `npm install` to install all of the packages needed to support the project.
  - Also a PATH moment
10. Run `npm run dev` to start the development environment for the app.
11. Navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your web browser of choice.
12. Look around the website, and mess with the code while you're at it.
13. If you want to save your changes, you can push them back to your GitHub which I challenge you to do alone.
14. Have fun!
